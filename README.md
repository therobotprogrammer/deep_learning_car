Deep Learning: End to End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars


•	Implemented Nvidia’s paper ‘End to End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars’ from scratch

•	Handled class imbalance using a custom sampling method that can over/under sample to match a reference distribution

•	Modified network architecture and simulator to support multiple cameras. Simulated Car drives successfully using cameras

•	Enhanced Keras’s data generator for multi-input multi-output time series data and support augmentations across time
